## Analysis
1(a&b).The highest rated restaurants are La perica Hamburguesa, Restaurant pueblo Bonito, Restaurante y pescaderia Tampico and Vips with an overall rating of 5, now what is common among these restaurants is the fact that their most preferred cuisines is the Mexican cuisine.

2. The average age of consumers is 27
 
Marital Status; from the data set 128 consumers with a percentage of 92.75% are single while 10 of the consumers with a percentage of 7.25% are married.

Occupation; majority of consumers are students with a count of 120, followed by the employed  with a count of 16 and lastly the unemployed with a low count of 2.
Ages from 25 below are classified as young adults with 72.46% with a count of 100, Ages from 25-33 are grouped as youth with 18.25% and count of 26, Ages from 72 and above are grouped as Elderly with 5.8% with a count of 8, while Ages from 45-69 are considered middle-aged with 2.9% and a low count of 4.

 This shows that there was a bias in the data sample as age groups between 25 below, 26-33 and 45-69 were considered as kids
 
3.Consumer Budget
99(71.01%) consumers had a medium budget,35(25.36%) Consumers had a low budget and 5(3.62%) had a high budget
 Cuisines Price
33(25.36%) cuisines had a high price, 58(42.03%) had a medium price and 47(34.06%) had a low price.

When demand was too high this affected the sales even in the highest rated restaurants whereby cuisines are not available to the consumers causing a stalling point in the restaurants and poor first impressions.
